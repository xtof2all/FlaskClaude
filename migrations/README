Generic single-database configuration with alembic.

This directory contains database migrations for the FlaskClaude application.

If you're setting up the project for the first time:

1. The initial migration is already included and creates the user table
2. Simply run: `flask db upgrade`

To create new migrations after modifying models:
1. Make your changes to the models
2. Run: `flask db migrate -m "Description of changes"`
3. Review the generated migration in migrations/versions/
4. Apply it with: `flask db upgrade`

To roll back a migration:
`flask db downgrade`
